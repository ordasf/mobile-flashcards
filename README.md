# Mobile Flashcards

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

This project is the third assignment of the React course by Udacity. To run the application download the source code
and then type in the console the next commands depending on the package manager you are using:

* Using yarn ->  `yarn install` and `yarn start`
* Using npm ->  `npm install` and `npm start`

NOTE: The install command in both yarn and npm only is necessary the first you run the app to install the dependencies.
